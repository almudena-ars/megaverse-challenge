# Metaverse-challenge


## Overview
This project implements the Crossmint Challenge using a throttled request system and API-based planet creation services. It includes functionality to parse map data, create game objects, and interact with an external API while respecting rate limits.

## Features
- Throttled request sending with multithreading support
- API service layer to create Polyanets, Soloons, Comeths, and fetch map goals
- Task extraction from map data for automated planet creation
- Unit tests covering core functionality and API interactions

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher

### Python Packages
- `requests` (for HTTP requests)
- `unittest` (built-in, for testing)
- `unittest.mock` (for mocking in tests)
- Other standard libraries: `queue`, `threading`, `time`


Thank you to the Crossmint team for giving me the opportunity of resolving this challenge!
